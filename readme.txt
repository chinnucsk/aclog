This is a smart metering project. 

There are several intentions for this project:
- learning Erlang
- learning jQuery
- learning how to use cloud like services 
     (where is the erlang cloud server? -> not realized yet, just use a simple linux vServer)
- beeing able to analyse my data without feeding google with my data

There is anothjer part of the project which isn't documented here. I am using the ethersex 
project with just a small change (got included in the ethersex recently) this is obviously 
stored at: 
https://github.com/ethersex/ethersex
